# cpp_name_string_manipulator
The Name String Manipulator Program (C++) uses a loop to ask a user to enter a name in FirstName MI LastName format (MI represents middle initial). 

A string is passed to a function that converts the input to LastName, FirstName MI format. The resulting string is printed to the console.

The program was designed with inclusivity in mind, allowing users without middle names to enter N/A for middle initials. Additionally, the program allows users to enter last names that contain spaces.
